## Assignment 1 - Basic Mathematical Operations and Greeting

### Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
This task takes **two numbers** from the user and performs:  
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

**Example**:
```textEnter the first number: 10
Enter the first number: 18
Enter the second number: 4

Addition: 22
Subtraction: 14
Multiplication: 72
Division: 4.5
