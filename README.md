## Assignment 1 - Basic Mathematical Operations and Greeting

### Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
This task takes **two numbers** from the user and performs:  
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

**Example**:
```text
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the first number: 18
Enter the second number: 4

Addition: 22
Subtraction: 14
Multiplication: 72
Division: 4.5
```
### Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
This task asks the user for their **first and last name** and prints a welcome message.  

**Example:**
```text
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
```

## Assignment 2 - Even or Odd and Sum of Numbers

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
This task checks whether a given number is **even or odd** using conditional statements.

**Example:**
```text
Enter a number: 18
18 is an even number.

```
### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
This task calculates the **sum of numbers from 1 to 50** using a `for` loop.  

**Example:**
```text
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275

```
---
## Assignment 3 - Factorial and Math Module
### Task 1: Factorial using Recursion
This task demonstrates how to calculate the factorial of a given number using a recursive function.

**Example:**
```text
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120

```
---
### Task 2: Using Python Math Module
This task demonstrates the use of Python’s `math` module by performing the following calculations:

- Square root
- Logarithm
- Sine of a number


**Example:**
```text
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
 ```
---
## Assignment 4 - File Handling
### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
This task reads a file (sample.txt) if it exists; otherwise, it prints an error message.

**Example:**
```text
Reading file content:
Line 1 : This is a sample text file.
Line 2 : It contains multiple lines.

```
---
### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
This task writes user input to a file (output.txt) and allows appending additional data.

**Example**
```text

Enter text to write to the file: Hello, Python!
Data successfully written to output.txt.

Enter additional text to append: Learning file handling in python
Data successfully appended.

Final content of output.txt: 
Hello, Python!
Learning file handling in python

```

## Assignment 5 - Dictionaries and List Slicing
### Task 1: Creating a Dictionary of Student Marks
This task demonstrates accessing dictionary values using user input.

**Example:**
```text
Enter the student's name: Alice
Alice's marks: 94

```
### Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
This task uses list slicing to extract the first five elements from a list and then reverses them to display the result.

**Example:**
```text
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted element: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
